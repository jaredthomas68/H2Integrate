    A controller that manages commodity flow based on demand and storage constraints.

    The `DemandOpenLoopController` computes the state of charge (SOC), output flow, curtailment,
    and missed load for a commodity storage system. It uses a demand profile and storage parameters
    to determine how much of the commodity to charge, discharge, or curtail at each time step.

    Note: the units of the outputs are the same as the commodity units, which is typically a rate
    in H2Integrate (e.g. kg/h)

        config (DemandOpenLoopControllerConfig): Configuration object containing parameters
            such as commodity name, units, time steps, storage capacity, charge/discharge rates,
            efficiencies, and demand profile.

    Inputs:
        {commodity_name}_in (float): Input commodity flow timeseries (e.g., hydrogen production).
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").

    Outputs:
        {commodity_name}_out (float): Output commodity flow timeseries after storage to meet demand.
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").
            - Note: the may include commodity from commodity_in that was never used to charge the
                    storage system but was directly dispatched to meet demand.
        {commodity_name}_soc (float): State of charge (SOC) timeseries for the storage system.

        input commodity.
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").

                rather the system just does not use it (throws it away) because this controller is
                specific to the storage technology and has no influence on other technologies in
                the system.
        {commodity_name}_unmet_demand (float): Unmet demand timeseries when demand exceeds supply.
            Same meaning as missed load.
            - Units: Defined in `commodity_units` (e.g., "kg/h").
        total_{commodity_name}_unmet_demand (float): Total unmet demand over the simulation period.
